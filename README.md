# docker-image-strip
Experimental utility to "strip" docker images down to the bare minimum required to run an application.

The main idea behind this is based on the proposal [here](https://lists.projectatomic.io/projectatomic-archives/atomic-devel/2015-February/msg00016.html)

Right now things are just being prototyped as a proof of concept. If things materialize, more documentation will be written.
